    <h2>How to Use ISUStudySpots Map</h2>
    <br>
    <p>To use the map, simply click or tap on a red square on the map on the home screen to find directions, hours for the building, and a link to more information about the location. It should look something like this:</p>
    <br>
      <div id="photo"><img src="HTU3.png" alt="photo of pop-up menus">
  </div>
    <br>
    <p>If you are finding that some locations are not popping up when clicked or tapped, be patient. Sometimes the pop-up menus take a while to load. If no locations pop-up for you or you experience other problems with the map, your device may not be compatible with the map. </p>
